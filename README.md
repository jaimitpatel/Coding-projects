# Coding-projects
This repo is created in order to add projects that are related to my coding bootcamp.
You can find my repository at https://github.com/jaimitpatel/Coding-projects
Here is the link to my first project- https://github.com/jaimitpatel/Coding-projects/blob/main/index.html  and this is the link for the javascript for the project https://github.com/jaimitpatel/Coding-projects/blob/main/script.js


for the password generator project, I was able to make a script that would check to see if numbers, uppercase, and symbols were checked off and generate a password based on the specifications, and also added a slider between 8 and 128 digits for a password. 
However, I could not figure out what went wrong when i tried to generate the password. I tried using console.log to see if it was working, and it was at first, but without changing the code, it suddenly stopped working. I also was not getting any errors in dev console so I was unable to generate a password, even though I'm certain that the code would allow you to generate a password within a given criteria.
